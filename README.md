# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio built using the Django Framework. I have deployed it on lifebelikethat.pythonanywhere.com using pythonanywhere.

To run it locally:
```
# clone the repository

# create a venv if needed
python3 -m venv venv

# install the modules
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run server on port 8000
python3 manage.py runserver
```
